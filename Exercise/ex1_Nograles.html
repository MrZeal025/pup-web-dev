    <p><u>What is Lorem Ipsum?</u></p>
    <p>
        <strong><i>Lorem Ipsum</i></strong> is simply dummy text of the <small>printing</small> and <big> typesetting industry</big>. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry standard 
        dummy text ever since the 1500s, when and unknown printer took a gallery od the type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <mark>It has survived not 
        only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged</mark>. It was popularized in the 1960's with the released of the
        <strong>Letraser sheets</strong> containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with the desktop publishing software like <strong>Aldus Page Maker</strong> including
        version of Lorem Ipsum.

    <p><u>Why do we use it?</u></p>
    <p>
        <del>It is a long established fact that</del> a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is 
        that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using <b><em>‘Content here, content here’</em></b>, making it look like readable English. 
       <ins>Many desktop publishing packages</ins> and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for <em>‘lorem ipsum’</em> will uncover
        many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
