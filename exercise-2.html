    <p><u style="font-weight: 600;">What is Lorem Ipsum?</u></p>
    <p>
        <strong style="color: red;">Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry standard 
        dummy text ever since the 1500s, when and unknown printer took a gallery od the type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <mark style="background-color:rgb(251, 251, 129);">It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</mark> It was popularized in the 1960's with the released of the <strong style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">Letraser sheets</strong> containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with the desktop publishing software like <strong style="color: red; text-decoration: underline;">Aldus Page Maker</strong> including version of Lorem Ipsum.

    <p><u style="font-weight: 600;">Why do we use it?</u></p>
    <p>
        It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is 
        that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using <em style="font-weight: 600; background-color: rgb(251, 251, 129);">‘Content here, content here’
        </em>, making it look like readable English.Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for <em style="font-weight: 600; background-color: rgb(251, 251, 129);">‘lorem ipsum’</em> will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
